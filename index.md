# NSW Property Logbook

## What is the NSW property logbook?

The NSW Department for Services, Finance, and Innovation has worked with builders, building industry associations, insurance companies, and other NSW Government teams to create a logbook for all properties in NSW. 

## Where we get our information

Every time a house is built, or has building work completed costing over $20,000, an insurance policy is taken out to protect the homeowner. We combine this data with Development Approvals from local councils, property sale data, and data from the Open Australia Foundation to create a property logbook.
